%h1#top Lesson 014 [ Chrome, APIs-Explorer: Google API Web-UI ]

%p Google offers many online products, Gmail for example.

%p Most people use a browser to interact with the products.

%p But Google allows us to write software which can interact with the products via Google APIs.

%p When I write software to interact with a Google API, I often encounter syntax, "How-to" questions.

%p Google offers the Google APIs-Explorer which I see as a Web-UI tool I can use to answer "How-to" questions.

%p This page offers some information I learned while training myself to use APIs-Explorer.

%p I started this lesson by logging into Gmail.

%p Next, I visited the URL listed below:

%a(target='g' href='https://console.developers.google.com') https://console.developers.google.com

%p The page wanted me to create a project (because I had no projects yet.)

%p If you visit the above page, and you already have a project you should see info about that project.

%p Otherwise the page will encourage you to create your first project.

%p The default name of your first project is: "My First Project".

%p What is a Project?

%p I see a Project as a named container of information which I can see with my browser.

%p So a Project is like a folder or a file full of information.

%p So, I created a project, "dan-project1", and waited two minutes for the project to appear:

%img(src='/lesson014/lesson013g.png')
%hr/

%p On the left, I clicked the Library link.

%p Google served me the Library-page:

%img(src='/lesson014/lesson013h.png')
%hr/

%p At the lower left I clicked the square: "Google Drive API".

%p Google served me a page:

%img(src='/lesson014/lesson013i.png')
%hr/

%p I clicked the blue-button: "ENABLE".

%p Google enabled the API for me and then served me a page:

%img(src='/lesson014/lesson013j.png')
%hr/

%p At this point I was ready to use APIs-Explorer which I started by visiting the URL listed below:

%p
  %a(target='g' href='https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer') https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer

%p Google served me a page:

%img(src='/lesson014/lesson014a.png')
%hr/

%p It is obvious from that page that Google offers many APIs.

%p I used the search field to search for the Explorer for the Google-Drive API.

%p The URL for that Explorer is listed below:

%p
  %a(target='g' href='https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/drive/v3/')
    https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/drive/v3/

%p After I visited the above URL, Google served me a page:

%img(src='/lesson014/lesson014b.png')
%hr/

%p To be continued ........
