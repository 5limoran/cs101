%h1#top Lesson 018 [ Python Meetup 2019-08-22 ]

%p This lesson is customized for Python Meetup 2019-08-22.

  Summary:
  Python + Google [pdb drilldown]
  \===============================
  
  In May, Wesley Chun presented a wide exploration of Google APIs with Python.
  
  In this presentation, Dan Bikle presents a drill-down into some
  specific scripts which connect Python with Google services via Google APIs.
  
  The presentation will be targeted at people new to both Python and Google APIs.
  
  Using Python to interact with Google APIs is an effective way to learn both technologies.
  
  Each script will serve as a stand-alone lesson.
  
  To start, Dan will discuss each script from a general perspective.
  
  Then Dan will operate each script inside the Python pdb debugger to give
  you a look at how each line contributes action to an overall goal.
  
  Some topics we cover will be listed below:
  
  * Ubuntu as a training and development environment.
  * GCP Projects
  * Accessing an Ubuntu environment from a chrome browser.
  * Python installation.
  * Python packages
  * Installation of google-api-python-client
  * pdb
  * Google product categories
  * Google Drive
  * Google Sheets
  * GCP Service Accounts
  * Authentication + Authorization + JSON
  * Service Account Key creation
  * Google Drive + Python
  * Local-File read-write with Python
  * Python-Only Google Authentication
  * Declare Authorizations with Python
  * File upload to Google Drive
  * Python manipulation of Google Drive permissions:
  * * Make file world-readable
  * * Grant write-privilege to a gmail-address
  * List Sharable-URLs of files in Google Drive
  * Google Sheets + Python
  * Create a Sheet
  * Understand "A1 Notation"
  * Add rows to a Sheet
  * * Make Sheet world-readable
  * * Grant write-privilege to a gmail-address
  * Sheets are complicated, So is the API.
  * Let's explore the Sheets API.

%h1 Ubuntu as a Training and Development Environment

%p When I offer training to my students I want them to use Ubuntu.

%p Why?

%p Ubuntu offers a stable consistent experience in a world which frequently changes.

%p The two main alternatives, Mac and windows, offer an inconsistent experience in a world which frequently changes.

%p If I write a simple software lesson on Mac or windows in 2019, that lesson will be instructive for somewhere between 12 days and 12 months.

%p If I write a software lesson on Ubuntu18 in 2019, that lesson might be instructive until 2023 when Ubuntu18 is replaced by Ubuntu20.

%p Ubuntu offers other advantages as well but consistency is my main pitch.

%p As a student-developer, how to get access to Ubuntu18?

%p I suggest some possibilities:

%ul
  %li Buy an Ubuntu laptop [this is what I do].
  %li Run Ubuntu inside Mac or windows using Virtualization.
  %li Run Ubuntu on the cloud inside my GCP account.
  %li Run Ubuntu on the cloud inside my AWS account.

%p In this Meetup, I will show you Python demonstrations using Ubuntu18 on the cloud inside my GCP account.

%p If my WIFI dies, I will show you Python demonstrations using Ubuntu16 on my laptop.

%h1 GCP Account

%p If you want a GCP account you will need a credit card.

%p I got my credit card and I searched for the GCP $300 credit:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=GCP+$300+credit' target='x')
    https://www.google.com/search?q=GCP+$300+credit
    
%p I used the above link, and my credit card to get a GCP account.

%h1 Login to GCP Account

%p To login to my GCP account I visit the URL listed below:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=GCP+Login' target='x')
    https://www.google.com/search?q=GCP+Login

%p I usually study the above page and then visit this URL:
%p
  %a(href='https://cloud.google.com/' target='x')
    https://cloud.google.com/
    
%p I used the above page to help me login using a mechanism similar to the forms I use to login to Gmail.

%p I saw this:

%p After you create your GCP account you will see something different.

%p So that we are both on the same page, I suggest that you create a new project named: "mup0822" which corresponds to Meetup 08-22.

%p To do that I searched Google with a how-to question:

%p
  %a(href='https://www.google.com/search?q=In+Google+Cloud+GCP+How+To+Create+Project' target='x')
    https://www.google.com/search?q=In+Google+Cloud+GCP+How+To+Create+Project
