%h1#top Lesson 012 [ GCP Python Library ]

%p I started this lesson by using a Chrome browser to login to my gmail account.

%p Next, to make Google happy, I pulled a credit-card out of my wallet.

%p Then, I tried to get the $300 GCP Free Trial:

%p
  %a(href="https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial") https://console.developers.google.com/freetrial


%p After some unfriendly behavior from the credit-card entry form, I got my $300 credit for GCP.

%p If you encounter problems with the credit-card entry form, complain to Google, maybe they will fix it.

%p After I clicked through the credit-card flow, I clicked on the icon for "Compute Engine".

%hr/

%p GCP needed about 90 seconds to "get ready".

%p Then it offered me a screen to create a new VM-Instance.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012c.png')
%hr/

%p I clicked the "quickstart" button.

%p A window appeared which offered informational links rather than a quick-start of a VM-Instance.

%p So, I dismissed the window and clicked the blue "Create" button.

%p It offered me a form allowing me to customize a new VM-Instance.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012d.png')
%hr/

%p I assumed that the default selections were good enough and I clicked the blue "Create" button.

%p It used 90 seconds to create an instance and then served me a status page.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012e.png')
%hr/

%p In that page I clicked the small-black-SSH link.

%p GCP served me a new window with a shell prompt in it.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012f.png')
%hr/

%p I disliked the small font and black background so I changed it with the gear icon.

%p Next, I asked google.com a simple question:

%a(href="https://www.google.com/search?q=What+are+the+GCP+shell+commands") https://www.google.com/search?q=What+are+the+GCP+shell+commands?

%p Google served me some links and I learned from those links that GCP has two main shell commands:

%ul
  %li gcloud
  %li gsutil

%p Next, in my Chrome browser, I visited this URL:

%p
  %a(href="https://console.cloud.google.com/compute") https://console.cloud.google.com/compute

%p At the top, I clicked the blue-link: "CREATE INSTANCE".

%p It served a page to me which looked familiar:

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012h.png')
%hr/

%p At the bottom, I did not click the blue-"Create" button.

%p Instead, I clicked the blue link: "command line".

%p GCP served me command-line-syntax:

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012i.png')
%hr/

%p I grabbed that syntax with my mouse, and then enhanced it, so you can see it better:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson012j'

%p Next, I used my mouse and vim to place the un-enhanced "command line" syntax into a file on the VM-instance I had started earlier.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012k.png')
%hr/

%p I saved that file and ran it as a Bash command.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012m.png')
%hr/

%p GCP complained.

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012n.png')
%hr/

%p I responded with a Bash command:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code gcloud auth login

%p That command entered me into a dialog with a browser window and my bash prompt.

%p After that dialog I tried this command again:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code bash gcloud10.bash

%p It responded favorably:

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012p.png')
%hr/

%p Next, I wrote a Python script to let  gcloud10.bash act as a template.

%p The Python script created five other Bash scripts from the template.

%p Also, the Python script ran each of the Bash scripts.

%p The Python script is listed below:

.syntax
  %pre
    =render 'lesson012q'

%p I ran the Python script and collected output for you to see:

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012r.png')
%hr/

%p I visited this URL:

%p
  %a(href="https://console.cloud.google.com/compute") https://console.cloud.google.com/compute

%p I saw evidence that the Python script worked well:

%img(src='/lesson012/lesson012s.png')
%hr/

%p In the above page I used my mouse to "Delete" all of the instances listed.

%p I no longer needed them and I wanted to avoid cloud charges to accumulate in my account.
