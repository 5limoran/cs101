Hello World,

I want to write a simple Python script which does the same thing as this shell command:

cs101@l77:~/cs101/public/lesson012$ gcloud compute instances list
NAME  ZONE           MACHINE_TYPE   PREEMPTIBLE  INTERNAL_IP  EXTERNAL_IP     STATUS
dan1  us-central1-a  n1-standard-1               10.128.0.9   104.197.47.250  RUNNING
cs101@l77:~/cs101/public/lesson012$ 

The fact that the above shell command works on my laptop is a good sign.

I have gcloud installed and I can use it to authenticate.

Also my GCP account seems to behave well inside the GCP servers.

I studied this URL:

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/tutorials/python-guide

I tried to walk through the steps in the above guide and got confused by poor writing:

- Many of the links lead to general information
- The Python syntax is incomplete (missing imports for example)
- The Python syntax in the page does not match the syntax on github

Currently I am stuck at this step:

"Authorizing Requests"

The page says this:

Application default credentials are provided in Google API client
libraries automatically. You just have to build and initialize the API:

compute = googleapiclient.discovery.build('compute', 'v1')

So, I wrote a simple Python script:

"""
gcp1.py

Demo:
gcloud init
pip3 install google-api-python-client
python3 gcp1.py
"""

import googleapiclient.discovery
compute = googleapiclient.discovery.build('compute', 'v1')

I ran the above script...
